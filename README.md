# Applied Data Science for Data Analysts 
 Course description is available [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-for-data-analysts/home/welcome)
 
### About this course
From this course, you will develop your data science skills by solving real-world problems through the various machine learning processes by using unsupervised learning to explore data, engineer and select meaningful features, and solve complex supervised learning problems using tree-based models. You will aslo learn on how to apply hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation strategies to improve model performance. Furthermore, you will learn the bias-variance trade-off, which is the heart of  many machine learning based projects.

The overall objective of the course are
* Explore data using unsupervised machine learning
* Solve complex supervised learning problems using tree-based models
* Apply hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation strategies to improve model performance

Tools and Langauges

* Databricks Community edition
* Spark SQL
